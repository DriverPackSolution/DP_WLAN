[5.93.97.34]
Fixes:
Added the .rc file back in the project. The driver will include version information.
Enabled the watch dog timer. Clock management is back on.
Added status check to registry open call, so that in case the hive is not available in a D3 to D0 transition, the driver will not crash the system.
In case open fails, transition back to D0 still succeeds, but any registry overrides will be ignored.

[5.93.97.33]
Fixes:
Corrected the flags in wake packet status indications.
Fixed a bug so that the wake packet NBL is not dropped, but indicated to the stack fast enough to avoid a resend.

such as transitioning from D3->D0 state)
-Added D0 Coalescing support in Broadcom SDIO INF file
-Driver signing on binaries

New features:

support IPv6 packets)

              -Decreased support of pattern matched payload to 74bytes(
requirement may have been 128bytes, MS needs to comment on this)

              -Fixed wake packet pattern payload problem(due to a bug it used 
to only send up 4bytes)

-NPOS & power transition
              -Basic power down transition to D3
